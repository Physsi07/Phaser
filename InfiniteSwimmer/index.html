    <!-- GAME DOCUMENTATION -->
    <!--
      1. There are two states, 'gameState' and 'gameOverState'.
      2. You have your preload, create, update and render function already defined.
      3. 'createPrimaryConsumers' & 'createPredators' that whenever they are called it creates
      this objects outside the screen and make them move to the left at a certain velocity.
      4. We have 'collisionPCHandler' & 'collisionPPHandler', two functions that checks for collision
      detection every second the game is running and each one of them executes its own content.
      5. There is a 'levelHandler' funciton that controls what happends on each level,
      simple, if just checks on which level the current player is on every second that the game
      is running and with simple if-else conditions we manipulate what we want to do at each level
      6. Finally, The 'restart' function stops evrything and shows the 'gameOverState', it re-initiates
      everything, level, score, players position, it suppose to restart everything as a new game and when
      the restart button is click it moves back from 'gameOverState' -> 'gameState'
     -->

     <!-- THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED -->
     <!--
       1. Sounds and audio effects for [ collision with predators, collision with consumers,
       player dying, gameover, while in game is been play ]
       2. Animated stickers without the with border around and all looking vertically to the left
       3. Scroolable background from Noelle, and design of maybe logo of game, or just in general how everything looks
       4. A restart button design by Noelle
       5. Also, maybe 'Game Over' logo or sticker
